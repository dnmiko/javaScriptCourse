Repo containing the code for the JavaScript Udemy Course

##Folder Structure
The structure for this project is the one requested by the Udemy course, where there is a main folder for each section of the course. Inside each one of them, there is a "final" and "starter" folder. The "final" one is the complete version of the section provided by the professor, while the "starter" one contains the code developed by me.
